This is an Object Detection Project Made by Eng: Omar Khaled,
I used Roboflow to make Images Annotation and as a Data Augmentation tool then I started to train the pretrained model.
The MaP was 99.4% which gave the model high detection Accuracy.
Then I used YOLOv7 customized model to train on the images.
Images was split into Train,Test and Validation, you can find Info about the Data in the README.Roboflow.txt file.
The Model has descriptive comments to help you Understanding the code.
